            <h2>"Build, Invest, and Plan for Your Financial Future – Start Today!"</h2>
            <p>WealthCity is a financial education application for teens which combines gamification with real-world financial planning. The aplication lets users build and manage a virtual city with different roles like investment analyst, financial manager etc and making investment decisions like buying stocks, real estate, and more, while learning essential money management skills. As users progress through different levels, they gain knowledge on budgeting, saving, and investing, all while simulating real-life financial situations. Later on, if the user is above 18, they can seamlessly transition from the virtual world to real-world investing(which is an option), using the skills and savings they’ve accumulated in the game.</p>
            <h3>Key Features:</h3>

Personalized Financial Advice: Users receive tailored advice to improve their money management and investment strategies.</p>
Parental Monitoring: Parents can track their teen’s progress and contribute to their savings goals.
